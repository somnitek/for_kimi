<p>Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year. I heard that you were not doing so well a couple of years ago, around the time I got clean, and I wanted to reach out. I had wanted to help back then, but I did not really know how.</p>

<p>I am doing very well now, and I wanted to share that with you. You can see what I have been up to here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamessylvesterboyles">www.linkedin.com/in/jamessylvesterboyles</a></p>

<p>This is the only way I have to reach you, but I wanted to wish you well, even if you would rather not hear from me. That is okay, and I get that. I just want you to know that I always wanted to help you, even though I could never quite figure out how to do that in a meaningful way. Maybe you never needed it. I honestly do not know.</p>

<p>I am fairly busy these days, but I decided to write this message as much for my own peace of my mind as anything. If you noticed, the last Cash App message I sent was two dollars. That was mostly just a test message. I did include my phone number there as well, which is 858-328-9702. I changed my number a while back for reasons similar to yours. There were some people I did not feel it was helpful to stay in contact with anymore. I hope you will excuse me if you are not looking to hear from me.</p>

<p>I realize that things were not left in a good way before, and that a lot was said. I also recognize that I do not really know your current situation. More than the money itself, I wanted to send the message. This is the second one you have received from me recently, and since I have not heard back, I take that as a sign that you are not eager to be in contact. I respect that, and I do not plan to send anything further unless I hear from you.</p>

<p>It took me a while to understand that, and I could be a bit dense sometimes, though getting sober helped with that quite a bit.</p>

<p>I truly hope you are not doing too badly. I was very sorry to hear about your mother. I hope you are safe, housed, and surrounded by people who care about you.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<p>Jimmy</p>
